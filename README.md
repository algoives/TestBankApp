# TestMe App

## Project Description

This is a testing application that lets a user test themselves based on technology specific quizzes. The user can register, login, take multiple quizzes, view their ranking vs other users, and leave feedback on the app. The admin user can login, create a quiz, view a user's scores, and block a user. The regular user is split into two types, free and subscribed. The subscribed user is limited to two quizzes per day.

## Technologies Used

Tech 1 - SQLite Tech 2 - Swift UIKit Tech 3 - Interface Builder

## Features

The application pulls from a test bank of 60 questions, 5 per quiz. The user can view their ranking both overall (on the results screen after each test) and by technology (on the ranking screen). The user can use the microphone on their phone to dictate their feedback.

## To-do list:

The application was supposed to have Facebook Login integration but this was scrapped due to time. The time given for each quiz is supposed to be 30 minutes, currently it's 30 seconds for testing.

## Getting Started

CLI cloning code: gh repo clone algoives/TestBankApp

Currently, this app is only intended, and packaged, to run on Xcode. If the app is cloned and ran in Xcode, the application should compile and run without issue.
